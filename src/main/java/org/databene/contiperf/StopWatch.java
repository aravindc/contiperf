/**
 * Stopwatch-style access to ContiPerf's {@link LatencyCounter} features.
 * A StopWach is created with a name and immediately starts measuring time.
 * When calling stop(), the elapsed time is registered at a central latency 
 * counter identified by the stopwatch's name.
 * <pre>
 *     StopWatch watch = new StopWatch("mytest");
 *     Thread.sleep(delay);
 *     watch.stop();
 * </pre>
 * You can use a stop watch only a single time, so you have to create a new 
 * instance for each measurement you are performing.
 * After the desired number of invocations, you can query the associated 
 * {@link LatencyCounter} from the CounterRepository and query its features, 
 * e.g.
 * <pre>
 *     LatencyCounter counter = CounterRepository.getInstance("mytest");
 *     System.out.println("avg:" + counter.averageLatency + ", max:" + counter.maxLatency())
 * </pre>
