ContiPerf 1.06 Release Notes
----------------------------

Improvements:
- Avoiding Windows' time resolution problem by using the most precise timer available on the system
- Reduced the impact of single slow threads on the total execution time: 
  Threads do not need to perform the same number of execution, each one runs as long as invocations are pending.
- Improved thread handling and statistics allocation for reducing memory impact
- Reduced the performance impact of the framework
